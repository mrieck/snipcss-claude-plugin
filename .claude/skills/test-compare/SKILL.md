# Compare Extraction Results

Run extraction on one or two selectors and compare/analyze the results.

## Mode 1: Single selector stability test (2 args)

If only URL and one selector provided:
1. Build: `npx tsc`
2. Run extraction twice on the same URL + selector
3. Compare the two JSON outputs
4. Report whether results are deterministic (identical CSS, HTML, Tailwind)
5. If differences found, show exactly what differs

## Mode 2: Two selector comparison (3 args)

If URL and two selectors provided:
1. Build: `npx tsc`
2. Run extraction on selector1, save to /tmp/snipcss-test-1.json
3. Run extraction on selector2, save to /tmp/snipcss-test-2.json
4. Compare:
   - How many CSS rules each produced
   - Whether they share any CSS rules
   - Tailwind class overlap
   - HTML structure differences

## Commands

```bash
# Run extraction and capture JSON
node dist/index.js --url "$URL" --selector "$SEL" --format json 2>/dev/null
```

## Output

Present results as a clear comparison table with pass/fail indicators.
Clean up temp files when done.
